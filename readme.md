# Project Title : Digital Marketing Home Page

## About

The project was about fixing the text and image in row direction using Flex.

## What Did I Learn

I have improved a lot more compared to my first Project.
This project taught me to use flex properly. I learnt to change the single text inside a heading using span.

## Time Taken To Finish The Project

Around 3 Hours.
